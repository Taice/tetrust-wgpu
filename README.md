# Tetrust WGPU
- written in rust using wgpu for graphics 
- pretty cool
- not fully featured tetris but it has the core gameplay mechanics (no holding and seeing next functionality)

# compilation and running
## compilation
- need rust
- clone repository
- just compile using rust: `cargo build --release`
## running
 if you want to download the binary you can refer to the downloads section to download it. (only on windows and linux, you're gonna have to build for your own platform otherwise)

 otherwise just run from the cloned repository `cargo run --release`
